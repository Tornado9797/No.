# No.
A Scratch game where you must outrun your opponent for a minute, or attempt to capture him.

This was the next stand-in project once I grew bored of working on Pokemon Battle Simulator. I wanted to make something similar and without any previous basis. That's when "No." was created. The game is simple: use the arrow keys to outrun the randomly moving spinning cat. If you succeed, you earn Yes, which is this game's ultimate goal. Collision results in No, or Game Over. Hitting spacebar attempts to capture the foe, but if it fails, then it's an instant No.

This program requires Scratch to run.
